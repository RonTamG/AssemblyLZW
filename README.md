Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression algorithm in assembly

Instructions:
  1. First input 1 or 2 if you want to compress or decompress respectively.
  2. Then input 2 file names, the first being the input file
          and second being the output file
  3. Wait for completion.
  
  You can use the files in the examples folder to test the compression and decompression
  
  1. alice29.txt - all of alice in wonderland
  2. grammar.lsp - code snippet written in the lisp programming language
  ( These 2 are taken from the cantrbry package ^)
  3. output.txt - blank file that can be used as the output for compression
  4. Decomp.txt - blank file that can be used as the output for decompression
